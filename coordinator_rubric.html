             <p>
                     <strong>Tendency Description:</strong> The Coordinator tendency describes characters who can move fluidly between surface and depth engagement while working to mitigate social friction. These characters act as intermediaries between individuals and systems, aiming to facilitate understanding and harmonious integration.

                   <strong>Passage Appropriateness Criteria:</strong>
                      <ul>
                            <li>The passage should depict a character who is trying to bridge a gap between those who understand a system and those who do not.</li>
                           <li>The passage should show the character moving smoothly through social interactions while leveraging a deeper understanding of the systems being navigated.</li>
                            <li>The passage should demonstrate the character’s capacity to understand both the surface-level rules and the underlying logic of the systems.</li>
                       </ul>
                </p>
                 <p>
                   <strong>Analytical Quality Criteria:</strong>
                       <ul>
                           <li>The analysis must explain how the passage shows the character working to reduce social friction within a systemic context.</li>
                            <li>The analysis must demonstrate the character’s ability to engage on both the surface level and the depth level.</li>
                           <li>The analysis must show that the character is motivated by a desire for integration, and must demonstrate how the character facilitates that integration.</li>
                          <li>The analysis must demonstrate an understanding of the tension between social friction/fit and surface/depth engagement as it appears in the passage.</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                 <p>
                    <strong>Scoring Guide:</strong>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pass:</strong> The analysis meets *all* of the analytical quality criteria and the passage meets all passage appropriateness criteria.</li>
                         <li><strong>Fail:</strong> The analysis fails to meet one or more of the analytical quality criteria, or the passage fails to meet one or more passage appropriateness criteria.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                 <p>
                   <strong>Notes for the AI:</strong> The key point is that the character must be shown to be actively working toward integration, helping others understand the system while maintaining social harmony. Simply understanding the system, or simply trying to create harmony, does *not* qualify.
