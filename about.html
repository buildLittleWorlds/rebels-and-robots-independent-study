            <h2>Project Context</h2>
            <p>The "Rebels and Robots" project was developed as a way to provide a structured and accessible method for analyzing characters in modern literature. The project centers on a practical framework that students can use to identify patterns of character interaction with both social and systemic forces. The system also provides an opportunity for an undergraduate to conduct meaningful and rigorous self-study.</p>

            <h2>Future Directions</h2>
            <p>The "Rebels and Robots" framework can be adapted and expanded in several ways. It could be used in more general education courses, in small group settings, or as a guide for personal reflection. Future work could also explore the intersection of character tendencies with other literary concepts such as setting or theme. The overall goal is to provide a useful tool for making meaning of character action, as well as human action in general.</p>
