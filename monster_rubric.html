      <h2>Rubric Description</h2>
         <p>
                    <strong>Tendency Description:</strong> The Monster tendency describes characters who experience high social friction while operating primarily at the surface level of engagement. These characters clash with societal norms without demonstrating a deeper understanding of the systems that cause their friction.

                    <strong>Passage Appropriateness Criteria:</strong>
                         <ul>
                            <li>The passage should depict a character who is clearly in conflict with their social environment.</li>
                             <li>The passage should demonstrate the character’s actions, which should be a reaction against social or systemic forces.</li>
                              <li>The passage should show that the character operates on the surface level, without any deeper analysis of the reasons for their social friction.</li>
                          </ul>
                </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Analytical Quality Criteria:</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The analysis must explain how the passage shows the character’s conflict with social structures and expectations, without necessarily understanding the origins of that conflict.</li>
                           <li>The analysis must show that the character responds emotionally or impulsively to a surface experience, without any real awareness of a deeper systemic reality.</li>
                           <li>The analysis must demonstrate an understanding of the tension between social friction/fit and surface/depth engagement as it appears in the passage.</li>
                            <li>The analysis must explain why the character does *not* engage with the world at a deeper level, using textual evidence to show a character who simply responds to experience, not to deeper analysis.</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                   <p>
                   <strong>Scoring Guide:</strong>
                    <ul>
                       <li><strong>Pass:</strong> The analysis meets *all* of the analytical quality criteria and the passage meets all passage appropriateness criteria.</li>
                       <li><strong>Fail:</strong> The analysis fails to meet one or more of the analytical quality criteria, or the passage fails to meet one or more passage appropriateness criteria.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                   <p>
                     <strong>Notes for the AI:</strong> Here, the key point is that the character should experience friction and respond negatively but should not demonstrate an understanding of the *reasons* for that friction. Passages where a character experiences friction while attempting to understand or change it do *not* qualify as Monster.
