          <h2>Rubric Description</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tendency Description:</strong> The Rebel tendency describes characters who experience social friction and who also demonstrate a deep understanding of the systems they seek to resist. These characters engage in informed and strategic opposition to the established order.

                    <strong>Passage Appropriateness Criteria:</strong>
                         <ul>
                             <li>The passage must depict a character who is in direct conflict with the dominant social and/or systemic forces.</li>
                            <li>The passage must demonstrate that this conflict is driven by an understanding of the mechanisms behind the social and/or systemic forces that they resist.</li>
                            <li>The passage should reveal that the character’s rebellion is the result of conscious, critical analysis, not simply an impulse reaction.</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                 <p>
                      <strong>Analytical Quality Criteria:</strong>
                         <ul>
                             <li>The analysis must explain how the passage shows the character directly resisting social and systemic forces.</li>
                             <li>The analysis must demonstrate the character’s understanding of the rules and procedures of the system they are resisting.</li>
                            <li>The analysis must also demonstrate how that character’s rebellion is based on their understanding of the mechanisms of the systems they resist.</li>
                             <li>The analysis must demonstrate an understanding of the tension between social friction/fit and surface/depth engagement as it appears in the passage.</li>
                         </ul>
                </p>
                   <p>
                   <strong>Scoring Guide:</strong>
                     <ul>
                       <li><strong>Pass:</strong> The analysis meets *all* of the analytical quality criteria and the passage meets all passage appropriateness criteria.</li>
                         <li><strong>Fail:</strong> The analysis fails to meet one or more of the analytical quality criteria, or the passage fails to meet one or more passage appropriateness criteria.</li>
                    </ul>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     <strong>Notes for the AI:</strong> The key point here is that the character is actively resisting a system, and their resistance must be motivated by an understanding of how that system works. Characters who resist out of a simple negative impulse do *not* qualify as Rebel.
