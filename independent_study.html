        <h2>Course Purpose</h2>
        <p>This section describes the structure of the independent study course and its goals. The aim is to provide a rigorous yet accessible approach to character analysis.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
         <p>The independent study course will help students:</p>
           <ul>
                <li>Master the "Rebels and Robots" framework.</li>
                 <li>Apply the framework to literary texts.</li>
                <li>Develop objective analytical skills.</li>
                 <li>Participate in self-directed learning with an AI tool.</li>
            </ul>
    </section>
   <section>
        <h2>Mini-Canon</h2>
             <p>The course utilizes a mini-canon of seven literary texts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Frankenstein (Mary Shelley)</li>
                <li>Bartleby, the Scrivener (Herman Melville)</li>
                <li>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Robert Louis Stevenson)</li>
                <li>Notes from Underground (Fyodor Dostoevsky)</li>
                <li>The Turn of the Screw (Henry James)</li>
                 <li>The Whisperer in Darkness (H.P. Lovecraft)</li>
                <li>The Metamorphosis (Franz Kafka)</li>
            </ul>
           <p>The texts were selected to provide a range of perspectives on the meaning of "modern," and will provide clear examples of the character tendencies for analysis.</p>
     </section>
      <section>
      <h2>Scaffolding</h2>
           <p>The sequence of texts is designed to provide a scaffolded learning experience, starting with simpler texts and moving towards more complex ones, building your analytical skill over time.</p>
       </section>
         <section>
            <h2>Assignment Structure</h2>
            <p>For each text, the student will:</p>
              <ul>
                    <li>Read the assigned text.</li>
                    <li>Identify passages exemplifying each of the five character tendencies.</li>
                     <li>Write short analyses (200-300 words) explaining *why* each passage is an example of each of the tendencies.</li>
                </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
              <h2>AI Integration</h2>
            <p>The AI tool provides personalized feedback on your analyses, helping you learn and improve. The AI tool will assess the suitability of passages for each of the character tendencies and the quality of the explanations. Here are a couple of sample responses to illustrate how this feedback will work.</p>

              <section class="sample-ai-response">
              <h3>Example 1: Passing Analysis</h3>
                    <p><strong>Student Text:</strong> The Metamorphosis</p>
                     <p><strong>Tendency:</strong> Robot</p>
                      <p><strong>Student Passage:</strong> “His parents did not understand his position well, and his mother would often just say, 'You must get used to it. It's not so bad. But you must get used to it.’”</p>
                     <p><strong>Student Analysis:</strong> This passage shows the robot tendency in the parents’ reaction to Gregor’s transformation. They are not looking for an explanation or a deeper understanding of what has happened. They are responding to it as a problem that needs to be addressed and that their son needs to “get used to.” They respond to the surface experience of the insect, not to the deeper personal experience of Gregor. They also express that surface-level reaction with a very typical phrase and in a way that shows they are simply following social expectations of how to respond to a family crisis. They are completely integrated into the normal social expectations and show no sign that they are considering the events at a deeper level.</p>
                      <p><strong>AI Feedback:</strong> This analysis is marked ‘Pass.’ The chosen passage is a very clear example of the robot tendency, and the analysis accurately explains why. The analysis demonstrates that the parents are working at a surface level and are responding to the situation by following social expectations without any deep engagement with the nature of their son's situation. The analysis also explains the tension between social fit and surface engagement, showing that the parents are smoothly integrated with the surface expectations of their social world. You should continue to work at this level of detail.</p>

                <section class="sample-ai-response">
                      <h3>Example 2: Failing Analysis</h3>
                        <p><strong>Student Text:</strong> Frankenstein</p>
                        <p><strong>Tendency:</strong> Rebel</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Passage:</strong> “I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to pieces, and triumph.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Student Analysis:</strong> This passage shows the rebel tendency in the creature’s reaction to Frankenstein. He does not like how he has been treated and he is responding to that treatment with malice, showing a rebellion against the injustice that he has experienced.</p>
                         <p><strong>AI Feedback:</strong> This analysis is marked ‘Fail.’ The chosen passage is an accurate example of a character experiencing social friction, but the analysis does not accurately explain why this passage is an example of the *Rebel* tendency. The analysis indicates that the creature is reacting to an injustice, but does not explain how the creature understands the larger system at work. The analysis fails to demonstrate that the creature's actions are a direct rebellion against a system it understands, rather than a reaction based on a surface-level understanding of injustice. The passage does not demonstrate any systemic understanding, which is required for the Rebel tendency. Please review the rubric and try again, making sure that your analysis accurately demonstrates both social friction *and* systemic understanding.</p>

                                <li>☐ Is my analysis clear, concise, and well-organized?</li>
                            </ul>
