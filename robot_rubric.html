        <h2>Rubric Description</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tendency Description:</strong> The Robot tendency describes characters who exhibit a high degree of social fit and operate primarily at a surface level of engagement. These characters follow rules and procedures without questioning them, often functioning as efficient components within a larger system.

                    <strong>Passage Appropriateness Criteria:</strong>
                        <ul>
                           <li>The passage should depict a character who is seamlessly integrated into their social environment.</li>
                            <li>The passage should depict a character following rules or procedures in a way that demonstrates no deeper engagement or analysis of the logic behind them.</li>
                            <li>The passage should depict a character who is primarily focused on adherence to external structures rather than any internal motivation or individual thought.</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Analytical Quality Criteria:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The analysis must explain how the passage shows a character smoothly moving through their social world.</li>
                            <li>The analysis must explain how the passage shows the character operating only on the surface of a system or set of rules, and must demonstrate that the character is unconcerned with any deeper systemic logic.</li>
                             <li>The analysis must demonstrate an understanding of the tension between social friction/fit and surface/depth engagement as it appears in the passage.</li>
                              <li>The analysis must explain why the character does *not* engage with the world on a deeper level, or demonstrate any resistance to the rules or procedures in the passage.</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                   <p>
                    <strong>Scoring Guide:</strong>
                    <ul>
                       <li><strong>Pass:</strong> The analysis meets *all* of the analytical quality criteria and the passage meets all passage appropriateness criteria.</li>
                         <li><strong>Fail:</strong> The analysis fails to meet one or more of the analytical quality criteria, or the passage fails to meet one or more passage appropriateness criteria.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                 <p>
                     <strong>Notes for the AI:</strong> The key here is that the character must be shown to be *unconcerned* with the reasons for rules and procedures, not just ignorant of them. Passages where a character is unaware of a deeper logic but is seeking it do not qualify as Robot.
