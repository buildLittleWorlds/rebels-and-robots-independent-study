         <h2>Rubric Description</h2>
             <p>
                    <strong>Tendency Description:</strong> The Genius tendency describes characters who exhibit a high degree of social fit but also demonstrate a deep understanding of the systems that govern their world. These characters can manipulate these systems to achieve their goals while maintaining social harmony.

                    <strong>Passage Appropriateness Criteria:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The passage should depict a character who is seamlessly integrated into their social environment and demonstrates an understanding of the system.</li>
                            <li>The passage should depict a character who is able to work within a system by leveraging an understanding of its rules and procedures, but without creating social disruption.</li>
                            <li>The passage should demonstrate that the character understands the system on a deeper level than simply following surface rules.</li>
                       </ul>
                </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Analytical Quality Criteria:</strong>
                        <ul>
                           <li>The analysis must explain how the passage shows a character smoothly moving through their social world.</li>
                           <li>The analysis must demonstrate the character’s understanding of the systems in the passage, and how the character leverages that understanding to achieve their goals.</li>
                           <li>The analysis must explain how the passage shows the character’s ability to integrate their actions with the social world.</li>
                            <li>The analysis must demonstrate an understanding of the tension between social friction/fit and surface/depth engagement as it appears in the passage.</li>
                      </ul>
                </p>
                   <p>
                   <strong>Scoring Guide:</strong>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pass:</strong> The analysis meets *all* of the analytical quality criteria and the passage meets all passage appropriateness criteria.</li>
                         <li><strong>Fail:</strong> The analysis fails to meet one or more of the analytical quality criteria, or the passage fails to meet one or more passage appropriateness criteria.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Notes for the AI:</strong> A key point here is that the character should be shown to be leveraging their understanding to achieve goals *within* the system without disrupting the harmony of that system. Characters who actively seek to undermine or rebel against the system do *not* qualify.
